<!--In a large project, itâ€™s common to have one parent template called
 base.html for the entire site and parent templates for each major section
 of the site. All the section templates inherit from base.html, and each
 page in the site inherits from a section template. This way you can easily
 modify the look and feel of the site as a whole, any section in the site,
 or any individual page. This configuration provides a very efficient way
 to work, and it encourages you to steadily update your site over time.-->
